v1.22
- Use pyparsing to read/write named.conf. This fixes bug:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=505754
- Use TCP 53 for DNSKEY queries

v1.21
- Enable DLV per default on systems that support /etc/sysconfig/dnssec
  (Fedora, RHEL, Centos)
- Fixes for Debian/Ubuntu by Ondřej Surý <ondrej@debian.org>
- Change default install to /usr/local
- Added key for .org.

v1.20
- dnssec-configure was not adding the reverse keys and DLV key to the
  named.conf file when enabling DLV for bind.
- dnssec-configure was not removing the DLV key from named.conf when
  disabling DLV.
- Bind did not properly support DLV's other then dlv.isc.org.

v1.19
- Added --nocheck option to be able to run dnssec-configure in %post of
  specfile, while there are no unbound key/pem files yet, and therefor
  unbound-checkconf would give an error. We cannot generate key files
  in %post, as we might not have enough entropy and would block an rpm
  process.

v1.18
- Fix for when Bind was installed, but Unbound was not [Adam Tkac]
- Added key for .th (Thailand) to testing
- Updated all reverse keys for RIPE's reverse zones

v1.16
- .gov went in production. Move key from testing to production
  See http://dotgov.gov/dnssecinfo.aspx
- Removed dnsops.gov from testing, its chains from .gov now exists.

v1.15
- New zones with keys assigned to RIPE: 109.in-addr.arpa. and 178.in-addr.arpa.
- .bg added a key and is in rollover.
- .gov key added to testing. They will not publish their DNSKEY outside
  DNS until they are considered production. Then the key should appear
  at https://www.dotgov.gov/dnssecinfo.aspx
- Don't use GNU extensions for cp. [Chris Lee]
- Look for the configuration files in more then just the Fedora places.
- Added key id's to all in-addr.arpa keys

  on older version of dnskey-pull)
- Minor updates on some keys in /etc/pki/dnssec-keys/testing/
